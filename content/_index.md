Hi! I'm Guifu, a Masters by Research student at the [Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation](https://informatics.ed.ac.uk/ilcc), University of Edinburgh. Currently I'm co-supervised by [Prof. Bonnie Webber](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/bonnie/) and [Prof. Hannah Rohde](http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~hrohde/). 

I am interested in implicit meanings and pragmatic uses of language. I am working on examining and improving these aspects in language models.
